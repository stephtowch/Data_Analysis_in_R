# Data_Analysis_in_R  

This GitHub repository contains R code for conducting a data analysis, specifically tailored for psychologists.

It will detail how to import, tidy, visualise, transform, and model a dataset using R through a worked example <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">

Key steps include:
- Importing and tidying data
- Imputing missing data where applicable
- Visualising data through histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, boxplots, and Q-Q plots
- Viewing descriptive statistics to gain insights into data distributions
- Transforming data, including univariate outlier analysis
- Utilising Cronbach's Alpha to assess internal consistency reliability
- Constructing a correlation data matrix to examine relationships between variables
- Modelling data using techniques such as simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and hierarchical linear regression

These steps are essential for understanding and interpreting data, ensuring robust analysis and informed decision-making. Let's delve into each stage to uncover valuable insights from our dataset.
